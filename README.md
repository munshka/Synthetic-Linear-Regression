# Synthetic-Linear-Regression

Synthetic linear regression, sometimes referred to as "synthetic data for linear regression," is a term that combines two concepts: "synthetic data" and "linear regression." 

1. **Synthetic Data:** Synthetic data is artificially generated data that mimics the characteristics and structure of real-world data. It is often created for various purposes, such as testing algorithms, training models, or augmenting limited datasets. Synthetic data is not collected from real observations but is generated using mathematical or statistical techniques. It allows researchers and data scientists to work with data when real data may be limited, private, or expensive to obtain.

2. **Linear Regression:** Linear regression is a statistical and machine learning technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In simple linear regression, there is one independent variable, and the goal is to find the best-fit linear equation (a straight line) that explains the relationship between the variables. The equation can be used for predicting the dependent variable based on the independent variable.

In summary, synthetic linear regression involves generating artificial data that follows a linear relationship and using this data to study or evaluate linear regression techniques.
